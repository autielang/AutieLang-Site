Autism is a language, Well, kind of.
Autistics interpret language differently to allistics, so why not create a language easy for autistics to understand?

Autie has one goal, to be accessible.

To accomplish this goal, Autie will
- Have similar syntax for written, spoken, and signed language
- Signpost language conventions that autistics have trouble with
- Have clear, constant, language conventions
